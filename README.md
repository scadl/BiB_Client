# BIB Client
This project is smal but fully functional billboard publishing and viewing system, built around really lightweight mobile client. The cleient app get its data from server, in form of JSON, via HTTP\HTTPS protocol. The server side written in php, while the storage of it -- is four mysql database tables.
## BIB server 
The "SERVER" are containing all the data you need to run server side of app. Just prepare database, and import data from my SQL sample file. Then adjust config.php values to suit your server setup. The folder of server scripts should be named 'bib', and have to sit in www root of you site. So before testing mobile app itself, test the installation from normal browser, opening someting like https://mysite.com/bib/
